# Modern
Modern is a free online art gallery that showcases a variety of artists. It is a website that offers a wide array of information about the featured artists and how their works have been translated in recent times.  

## Motivation
My main inpsiration for this website was due to the lack of online galleries that are online. It is difficult to appreciate certain artwork without travelling to the country it is located in and that is difficult for some. The website is made for people who would prefer to have a visual and informative experience in the comfort of their homes. 

# Build 
The main idea for the page is to be a single scroller. The top section of the page will be a nav bar on a background image It will have the web page title in the middle of the page.

Then the Artists section will feature the 3 artists and introduce them briefly. It's not final if it will be a round border or a rectangular

The Gallery section will showcase 3 artworks from the 3 artists in a grid/column view.
