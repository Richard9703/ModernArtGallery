# Modern Art Gallery
Modern Art Gallery is a free online art gallery that showcases a variety of artists. It is a website that offers information about artists and showcases all their works in hopes to inspire and educate people who aren't familiar with them and maybe re-ignite passion for some. It will be targeted to anyone who is eager to learn about art or are looking to view online galleries. this site will be useful for people love to avoid queues and crowds as everything will be virtual. 

## Motivation
My main inpsiration for this website was due to the lack of online galleries that are online. It is difficult to appreciate certain artwork without travelling to the country it is located in and that is difficult for some. The website is made for people who would prefer to have a visual and informative experience in the comfort of their homes. 

## Build Ideas
The next few images are the ideas of how I want the website to look and what will do where. 

The landing page will have navbar on top

Then the Artists section will feature the 3 artists and introduce them briefly.

The Gallery section will showcase 3 artworks from the 3 artists in a grid/column view.
